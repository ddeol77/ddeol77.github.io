		<h2>My thinking style - Concrete Random...i think...maybe?</h2>
		<li>I had a hard time categorizing myself into one of the 4 Gregorc Thinking Styles.  I know that I do really well with hands on project work
		especially when it's team based.  I struggle when I have to sit for long periods of time and read material.  I think the way DBC is setup is 
		great for someone like me. </li>
		<h2>My learning experience in Phase 0 so far</h2>
		<li>The biggest struggle for me has been making time to get the assignments completed.  I also have a hard time focusing on reading material for a long period of time.  I know everyone has other comittiments and it's not an excuse but working full-time and having a family does make it challenging
		to put in 15-25 hours a week towards these challenges.  Fortunately I was able to work something out with my employer and am taking a day off once a week
		in order to complete the Phase 0 assignments.  I also realized that I'm much more productive at my local library than at home.</li>
		<h2>Growth vs. Fixed mindset</h2>
		<li>I think that by having a combination of independent study, group activities, and projects that have creative input will help expand the ways we
		learn and think.  Personally I think that working on my weakness during the Phase 0 portion will help me.</li>
