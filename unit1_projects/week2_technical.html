	<ul>
		<li>The actual image or cell content and the area inside and between the borders are what are known as padding.  The area surrounding the contents is the padding. The padding completely surrounds the contents: to the top, bottom, left and right sides. </li>
		<li>The area outside of the border, between the border and the other elements beside the object are known as the margins. The area outside and entire object is also the margin. Like padding, the margin also surrounds the entire content: to the top, bottom, left and right sides. </li>
		<li>If you are thinking about modifying the css with margins and padding, be mindful that the box model is not accurately implemented in internet explorer. Meaning that your page will look unusual, more so in older browsers. </li>
