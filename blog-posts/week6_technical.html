		<h1><span class="accent">Inheritance</span></h1>
		<li>Inheritance describes a relationship between objects where one is a kind of the other.  With inheritance one of the objects is based off of the other one.  By using inheritance programmers can reuse code and make their code more efficient. </li>
		
		<li>When a new class is made from a base class using inheritance all of the methods of the base class are brought over or 'inherited' from the parent.  Methods that we may not need or want come over as well.</li>

		<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
		<li>The advantage of inheritance is how easy it is to create a new instance of a class, maintaining a hierarchy structure in the code, and the efficiency of reusing existing code.</li>

		<li>The disadvantage of inheritance is extremely close structure of the new classes created.  If the base class changes at all it will have a ripple effect down to all the subclasses and could cause new defects to be created.  If an application gets very large and complex this could be a real issue.</li>

		<h1><span class="accent">Composition</span></h1>
		<li>Composition describes a relationship between objects where one has characteristics of the other.  With composition you can pick and choose the methods you want to use so custom classes can be created.</li>

		<h1><span class="accent">Inheritance vs. Composition</span></h1>
		<li>The decision on whether to use Inheritance or Composition all depends on the situation.  If you answer the question 'is y a kind of x?' with a yes you should most likely start with inheritance to create your subclasses.  Inheritance is good for simple object relationships.</li>
		<li>But if the relationship is more complex and not just hierarchical then it's probably a good idea to use composition.  Composition gives you more flexibility and allows you to create code that will holdup to future changes.</li>
