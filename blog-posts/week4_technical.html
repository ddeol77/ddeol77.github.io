		<h2>Which Ruby loop or iterator should you use?</h2>
		<li>Ruby has a lot of different ways to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. We have read about loop, while, until, for, each, and times. There are several ways to loop in Ruby and I'll go over ways to print numbers 1 through 10 </li>
		<h2>Loop method</h2>
		<li>This is the most basic loop in Ruby.  This loop has several termination commands that can be used to make this loop effective.
		some of them are next, redo, and break.  If you want to exit a loop at any point the Break keyword allows that. </li>
		<h2>While Loop</h2>
		<li>This loop executes code while a specified conditional is true.</li>
		<h2>Until Loop</h2>
		<li>This loop executes code while the conditional is false.</li>
		<h2>For Loop</h2>
		<li>This loop allows you to apply a block of code to each element in an expression.</li>
		<h2>Each</h2>
		<li>This method allows you to execute with much less code. It is one of the simpler methods and run a block of statements for every element.</li>
		<h2>Times</h2>
		<li>This method is effective if you know how many times you need to execute a defined block of code.</li>
