		<h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
		<li>Make sure the questions you ask cannot be answered with just a 'Yes' or 'No.  If you do this you will get incomplete information.  Open-ended questions will get an answer that has insights and additional information that you may not know existed.</Li>

		<li>Follow-up the original question with another that digs deeper.  A good follow-up question to have is something like 'Why do you say that?' or 'Why do you think that?'</li>

		<li>After asking your question be patient and don't say anything.  If you are silent after asking the original question the responder will usually provide more critical information.</li>

		<li>Do not interrupt the other person.  This disrupts the other person's train of thought and does not allow them to answer you effectively.  The only time when this would be appropriate is if they go on a tangent.</li>
