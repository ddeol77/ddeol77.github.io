		<h1><span class="accent">What is Rails?</span></h1>
		<li>Ruby on Rails is an open source full-stack web application framework written in the Ruby Programming Language. Rails is capable of gathering information using pages and applications from the web server and can interact with a database and can retrieve information from the database.   </li>

		<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
		<li>Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier "out of the box", such as scaffolding that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic website.Also included are WEBrick, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and Rake, a build system, distributed as a gem. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.</li>

		<li>Rails running on Matz's Ruby Interpreter (the de facto reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.  These critics often mentioned various Twitter outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to Scala (which runs on the Java Virtual Machine) for their queueing system and other middleware.  The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance.</li>

		<h1><span class="accent">Philosophy and design</span></h1>
		<li>Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize Convention over Configuration (CoC), and the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle</li>

		<li>"Convention over Configuration" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sale in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called sales by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table "products sold", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition</li>

		<li>"Don't repeat yourself" means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ActiveRecord module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.</li>

		<h1><span class="accent">Popularity</span></h1>
		<li>Some of the largest sites running Ruby on Rails include GitHub, Yammer, Scribd, Shopify, Hulu, and Basecamp. As of May 2014, it is estimated that more than 600,000 web sites are running Ruby on Rails</li>
		<li>Despite criticisms and comparisons to Java, many high-profile consumer web firms are still using Ruby on Rails to build agile, scalable web applications  </li>
