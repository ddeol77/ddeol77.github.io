		<h2>Conflict</h2>
		<li>The last time I had conflict with someone was at work.  We had a disagreement about how to manage a client.  My co-worker wanted to do everything the client asked but I insisted we not say yes to everything.  Ultimately we agreed to disagree.</Li>
		<li>The source of the conflict was a difference in philosophies and beliefs.</li>
		<li>I tried to be respectful and explain my position without being offensive or rude.</li>
		<li>I think since the other person would not budge the conflict grew more instense initially.  After some more thought I realized the reasons why the other person had taken the position they had.  After that realization I was able to understand them better and the conflict died down.</li>
		<li>I think looking back now I would try to understand the other persons reasons for the position they were taking sooner</li>
		<li>I learned that everyone has their reasons for why the act and feel the way they do.  Once we realize that it's easier to understand people.</li>
