		<h2>The Stereotype Threat</h2>
		<li>I haven't personally felt the stereotype threat but can see how this may effect other groups of people.  I can see how a negative self-image can cause someone to not perform to their maximum potential and cause them to underachieve.</Li>
		<li>I think that we can try to educate minority groups who have this issue and help address the problem.  We would need to present this information at schools that have a high percentage of minorities and help create a positive self-image for them.  Once we help them identify this condition they can start to create strategies to overcome it.</li>
