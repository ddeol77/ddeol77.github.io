		<h2>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h2>
		<li>Javascript is supported by all browsers, it supports all functional programming	languages, it can be used as a client side or a server side language, and because of that it also supports objects and inheritance.   </li>
		<h2>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h2>
		<li>Javascript is very quick and responsive, it's a universal front end platform, and it works well on multiple devices.  It's quick and responsive
		because the language is very efficient and it communicates well with web servers and most tablets, e-readers, and smartphones have javascript.  The reason why is because it's beneficial for devices that have Apps. </li>
		<h2>What are it's limitations?</h2>
		<li>Limitations of JavaScript are that it cannot write to files on a server without the help of a server side script, cannot access databases on it's 
		own (need ajax), and it cannot acces web pages hosted on another domain.  There are ways to work around these limitations by using other libraries 
		or technologies.</li>
