		<h2>States and Behaviors</h2>
		<li>Since Ruby is an Object Oriented Programming language Classes are used to make Objects.  When 
		we define a class two things are usually the focus: States and Behaviors.  States are what track
		the attributes of the individual objects.  Behaviors are what the objects are able to do. </li>

		<h2>Initializing a New Object</h2>
		<li>Whenever a new object is created the initialize method is called.  Even though it looks like
	    we are calling the new method the initialize method is called eventually.  The initialize
	    method is referred to as a constructor since it is triggered whenever a new object is created.</li>

		<h2>Instance Variables</h2>
		<li>Instance variables are variables that exist as long as an object instance exists and it's how
		we tie data to objects.  They are responsible for keeping track of the information of the state
		of an object.</li>

		<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
		<li>These are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform. Instance methods can only be
	    called on an instance of a class.</li>

		<h2>Class Methods</h2>
		<li>There are also class level methods, called class methods. Class methods are methods we can call directly on the class itself, without having to instantiate any objects.</li>

		<h2>Class Variables</h2>
		<li>Just as instance variables capture information related to specific instances of classes (i.e., objects), we can create variables for an entire class that are appropriately named class variables. Class variables are created using two @ symbols like this: @@ </li>
