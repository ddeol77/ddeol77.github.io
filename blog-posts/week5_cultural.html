		<h2>Pairing</h2>
		<li>I really enjoy pairing with others to solve the challenges.  Two heads are better than one and
		someone else can always point something out that you overlooked or a mistake you may have made.  I 
		think it's rewarding when you solve a problem as a team and build comradery.  The only thing that
		can be frustrating or difficult would be if there is a problem with the communication in the team.  </li>
	
		<h2>Feedback</h2>
		<li>I'm usually appreciative of feedback when it's given.  I'm always trying to get better and I feel that constructive feedback is essential for that.  Going forward I will speak up more if the
	    person that I'm pairing with is not understanding concepts or is slowing the team down.  I enjoy
	    writing feedback helping someone else improve and get better.  I think feedback and pairing can
		help people understand concepts a lot quicker compared to just trying to tackle something alone.</li>
